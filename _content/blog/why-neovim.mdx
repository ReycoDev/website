As a software engineer, choosing and understanding your text editor is important part of your work, as it impacts your productivity and workflow efficiency. It's like choosing the perfect tool for any trade - you need to know what tool to use and how to use it effectively if you want to excel. For me, I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my editor and I have been using it for a little over a year now.

## Vim and its Benefits

Vim is a text editor that has been around for decades. Almost all servers running usually comes with some form of Vim preinstalled. It highly customizable and its popularity stems from serveral benefits:

### Speed and Efficiency

Vim is designed to be operated entirely with the keyboard, allowing for lightning-fast navigation and editing. Once you've mastered Vim's commands, you can perform tasks much more quickly than with a traditional mouse-driven text editor. Imagine never having to touch your mouse again while programming.

### Customizability

Vim is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the editor to their specific needs. Whether it's customizing key bindings, installing plugins, or tweaking settings, Vim can be adapted to suit any workflow.

### Modal Editing

One of Vim's most powerful features is its modal editing system. Vim has different modes for editing, navigation, and command entry, allowing users to perform a wide range of tasks without ever lifting their hands from the keyboard.

### Extensibility

Vim's plugin system allows users to extend the editor's functionality in countless ways. Whether it's adding support for new file types, integrating with external tools, or automating common tasks, Vim's extensive plugin ecosystem has you covered.

## In comes Neovim

While Vim is an excellent text editor, it does have some limitations. For instance, it's primarily maintained by a single lead developer. Its built using its own programming language making it harder for users to build and maintain plugins. Enter Neovim, a modern fork of Vim that seeks to address many of its shortcomings while still keeping vim at its core.

Developed in 2014 as a community-driven effort to modernize the Vim codebase, Neovim builds on Vim's features while also introducing several improvements and new capabilities. Some of the key features of Neovim include:

### Built in support for LSP

Language Server Protocol (LSP) is a protocol that allows programming languages to be easily supported across any editor. The LSP enables features such as code highlighting, syntax checking, code completion, inlay hints, type hints. Neovim ships with direct support for LSP making it more performant and easier to maintain vs dealing with external plugins.

### Improved Plugin Architecture

Neovim is built and configured using the [Lua](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html) programming language vs vimscript. This makes it easier to develop and maintain plugins. The Lua API also allows for more powerful scripting and performance.

### Actively Maintained and Developed

Neovim is developed by a community of contributors and is constantly being improved and updated with new features and bug fixes.

## Customizing Neovim

Customization is a crucial aspect of any text editor, as it allows users to tailor the editor to their specific needs and preferences. Neovim takes customization to the next level, offering a wide range of options for configuring the editor to fit your workflow. Customizing your text editor is essential for improving productivity and efficiency.

### My Experience with Customizing Neovim
Personally, customizing Neovim has been a game-changer for me. By tweaking the editor to fit my workflow, I've been able to significantly increase my productivity and focus more on writing code and less on repetitive tasks.

Some of the customizations I've made to Neovim include:

- *Custom key mappings*: I've defined custom key mappings to quickly access commonly used commands and plugins, allowing me to perform tasks more efficiently.
- *Syntax highlighting and theme*: I've customized Neovim's syntax highlighting and theme to make it easier to read and navigate my code.
- *Plugin configuration*: I've installed and configured several plugins to extend Neovim's functionality, such as auto-completion, code linting, and version control integration, and file navigation.

I also enjoy tinkering around with Neovim and learning about different plugins and workflows other engineers use. Whenever I am not feeling motivated on my projects, its usually something fun to take my mind off of things but still stay in  the scope of programming.

## Conclusion

I believe every Software Engineer should have a deep understanding of their text editor in order for them to be efficient at writing code. You can accomplish this with any text editor; you just have to put in the work. I chose Neovim as my editor as it is built on top of vim and easily customizable. It gave me a deeper understanding of how editors work under the hood and it improved my speed and efficiency at programming. I highly encourage you to give it a try and experience the journey of Vim and Neovim.
